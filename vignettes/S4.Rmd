## Understanding the `nexml` S4 object

The `RNeXML` package provides many convenient functions to add and extract
information from `nexml` objects in the R environment without requiring
the reader to understand the details of the NeXML data structure and
making it less likely that a user will generate invalid NeXML syntax
that could not be read by other parsers. The `nexml` object we have been using
in all of the examples is built on R's S4 mechanism. Advanced users may
sometimes prefer to interact with the data structure more directly using 
R's S4 class mechanism and subsetting methods. Many R users are more familiar
with the S3 class mechanism (such as in the `ape` package phylo objects)
rather than the S4 class mechanism used in phylogenetics packages such as 
`ouch` and `phylobase`. The `phylobase` vignette provides an excellent introduction
to these data structures.  Users already familiar with subsetting lists and other
S3 objects in R are likely familiar with the use of the `$` operator, such as
`phy$edge`. S4 objects simply use an `@` operator instead (but cannot be subset
using numeric arguments such as `phy[[1]]` or named arguments such as phy[["edge"]]).  


The `nexml` object is an S4 object, as are all of its components (slots).  Its 
hierarchical structure corresponds exactly with the XML tree of a NeXML file, with 
the single exception that both XML attributes and children are represented as slots.  
For each element in the XML tree of a NeXML file, there is an S4 class that is
named correspondingly, but prefixed with `nexml:` to prevent unintended name
clashes with classes defined in other packages. (Many NeXML elements have
short and rather generic names, such as `format`, `matrix`, `tree`, `char`,
`seq`, etc.) In the following we refer to these classes in their non-prefixed
form, to show the correspondence to the NeXML schema. The "root"-level `nexml`
class is _not_ prefixed, and should in general be the only class that
programmers may need to use directly.

S4 objects have constructor functions to initialize them.  We create a new `nexml` 
object with the command:

```{r}
nex <- new("nexml")
```

We can see a list of slots contained in this object with

```{r}
slotNames(nex)
```

Some of these slots have already been populated for us, for instance, the schema version and default namespaces:

```{r}
nex@version
nex@namespaces
```

Recognize that `nex@namespaces` serves the same role as `get_namespaces`
function, but provides direct access to the slot data.  For instance,
with this syntax we could also overwrite the existing namespaces with
`nex@namespaces <- NULL`.  Changing the namespace in this way is not
advised.

Some slots can contain multiple elements of the same type, such as
`trees`, `characters`, and `otus`.  For instance, we see that

```{r}
class(nex@characters)
```

is an object of class `ListOfcharacters`, and is currently empty,

```{r}
length(nex@characters)
```

In order to assign an object to a slot, it must match the class definition
of the slot.  We can create a new element of any given class with the
`new` function,

```{r}
nex@characters <- new("ListOfcharacters", list(new("nexml:characters")))
```

and now we have a length-1 list of character matrices,

```{r}
length(nex@characters)
```

and we access the first character matrix using the list notation,
`[[1]]`. Here we check the class is a `characters` object.

```{r}
class(nex@characters[[1]])
```

Direct subsetting has two primary use cases: (a) useful in looking up
(and possibly editing) a specific value of an element, or (b) when adding
metadata annotations to specific elements. Consider the example file


```{r}
f <- system.file("examples", "trees.xml", package="RNeXML")
nex <- nexml_read(f)
```

We can look up the species label of the first `otu` in the first `otus` block:

```{r}
nex@otus[[1]]@otu[[1]]@label
```

We can add metadata to this particular OTU using this subsetting format

```{r}
nex@otus[[1]]@otu[[1]]@meta <- 
  c(meta("skos:note", 
          "This species was incorrectly identified"),
         nex@otus[[1]]@otu[[1]]@meta)
```

Here we use the `c` operator to append this element to any existing meta annotations to this otu.
