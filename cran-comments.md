Dear CRAN maintainers,

This update addresses several minor issues and feature requests, as detailed in NEWS.md. This package shows one note, that one suggested dependency on a non-mainstream repository, which is used to illustrate an additional feature in one of vignettes, when available (taxadb).  This is not a new suggested dependency, it is already listed in the current CRAN version as well.  I have now listed an Additional_repository field for where to install `taxadb`.  

Cheers,

Carl
