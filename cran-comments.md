Dear CRAN maintainers,

This update addresses the check fail when checking with env var _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_ set
to true.  This also replaces a few dependencies that were available only from additional repositories (the omegahat.net repository) with alternate versions of these packages that are now available from CRAN. 

Cheers,

Carl
