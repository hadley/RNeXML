Dear CRAN maintainers,

This update addresses several minor issues and feature requests, as detailed in NEWS.md. 
This package shows two notes, one indicating that I am the maintainer, the other noting that this package
has one suggested dependency on a non-mainstream repository, which is used
to illustrate an additional feature in one of vignettes, when available.  (This is not a new suggested dependency, it is already listed in the current CRAN version as well.)

Cheers,

Carl
