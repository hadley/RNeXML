Dear CRAN maintainers,

This update addresses several minor bugs in the handling of ploymorphic 
characters, as detailed in NEWS.md. This package shows two notes,
one indicating that I am the maintainer, the other noting that this package
has one suggested dependency on a non-mainstream repository, which is used
to illustrate an additional feature in one of vignettes, when available.  

Cheers,

Carl
